# How to code simple data

This course, part of the Software Development MicroMasters Program, presents a core design method with a focus on numbers, strings, images and lists.

You will learn techniques to:
- Develop program requirements
- Produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later
- Make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.

This course concludes with the design of a simple interactive game: Space Invaders

Specifically, you will learn:
- How to represent information as data
- How to focus each part of your program on a single task
- How to use examples and tests to clarify what your program should do
- How to simplify the structure of your program using common patterns
- Recognize and represent more complicated information

It is a very interesting course where you will program in Racket. As Wikipedia indicates, Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. The Racket language is a modern dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme. To program, you will use DrRacket, which is a graphical environment for developing programs using the Racket programming languages.

I have done this course as part Computer Science - Core Programming from OSSU (Open Source Society University). Don't hesitate to take the course on the edX platform. Optionally, you may obtain the corresponding certificate if you're interested in this type of certification.

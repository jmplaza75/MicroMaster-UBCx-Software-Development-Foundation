# SoftConst1x  UBCx: Software Construction: Data Abstraction

This repo includes all sources from the course UBCx SoftConst1x Software Construction: Data Abstraction. All of them, have been forked from [UBCx-Software-Construction](https://github.com/UBCx-Software-Construction), where you can find each repository individually. 

The course begins with the topic of data abstraction - from specification to implementation. 

Particular attention is given to how to write robust tests using JUnit. Then the course expands on these ideas to explore how type hierarchies and polymorphism can be used to decrease redundancy in your code. The course wraps up with a discussion of how to design robust classes.

By the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation in designing software in Java, and be ready to move onto Software Construction: Object-Oriented Design, where you will learn more complex design patterns and principles designing object-oriented programs.

The final project, covers the creation of an Oval shape in the same way that a rectangle shape is created playing a midi sound.

I have done this course as part Computer Science - Core Programming from OSSU (Open Source Society University). Don't hesitate to take the course on the [edX platform](https://www.edx.org/). Optionally, you may obtain the corresponding certificate if you're interested in this type of certification.

# Final Project - Oval shape

This is the final project of this Course. 

In this project, it has been added an additional tool (and all its underlying functionality) to make an Oval tool that plays a different sound!  You can read about how to make different midi sounds here: https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/gm-level-1-sound-set.

To achieve this goal of the project, it has been necessary to perform:

- add a button to the tool bar, by examining how it's currently done for all the other buttons, and then duplicating that functionality.
- add a tool class that implements the new button by looking at how the ShapeTool class works
- add a class that implements the new shape by looking at how the Shape class works
- think about how to reduce duplication using subclassing!

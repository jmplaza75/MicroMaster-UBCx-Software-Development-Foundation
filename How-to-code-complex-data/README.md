# How to code complex data

This course quickly expands to cover more complex programs on more complex data. Towards the end of the course, you will design programs that even experienced developers would find challenging.

You will also learn how to design search programs. You will design a program to solve Sudoku puzzles, and will be able to design many other puzzle solvers as well.

This course concludes with a timed exam.

Specifically, you will learn:
- How to identify commonalities in data definitions and functions
- How to avoid repetition using abstraction
- How to design functions that operate on graphs
- How to design programs that search a given problem space to find a valid solution

It is a very interesting course where you will program in Racket, but I prefer How to Code: Simple Data. 
As Wikipedia indicates, Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. The Racket language is a modern dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme. To program, you will use DrRacket, which is a graphical environment for developing programs using the Racket programming languages.

I have done this course as part Computer Science - Core Programming from OSSU (Open Source Society University). Don't hesitate to take the course on the edX platform. Optionally, you may obtain the corresponding certificate if you're interested in this type of certification.
